Fresh bread, still warm! a vendor cries, and coins clink as customers crowd the stall.
The market roars with haggling voices, and someone shouts, That's my last price!
Two for one! echoes down the street, but the crowd's chatter nearly drowns it out.
A butcher laughs behind his counter, and a buyer snaps back, You call that a deal?
The market hums with footsteps and laughter, and a child's voice asks, Can we buy it?
